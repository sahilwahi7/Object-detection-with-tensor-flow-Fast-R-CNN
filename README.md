# Object-detection-with-tensor-flow-Fast-R-CNN
 Object is important task for the perception task
and has various advatages in autonomous driving, perception stack of any AI device and hence requires special attention.
There are many ways to implement object detection which include-
1.YOLO algorithm
2.R-CNN
3.Fast R- CNN
and many more for furthur models visit https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection

In this module we would discuss about the object detection implementation with TensorFlow.
